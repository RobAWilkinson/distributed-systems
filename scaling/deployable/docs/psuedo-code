Proxy Server/DNS Resolver
- Has a List of names it can resolve to IPs
- listens to subdomains, domains or path (or even get parameter)
  -If on the list-Directs or Proxies to the registrator
- listens for a computer to register with it
  - On registration-Adds name to the list
  - On disconnect-Removes it from the list
